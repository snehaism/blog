Why do we remember yesterday but not tomorrow?

This question might seem whimsical at first glance, but it strikes at the heart of a profound mystery in physics: Why does time have a direction? We wake up each day older, never younger. Coffee cools down, never heats up spontaneously. Broken cups don’t jump off the floor and reassemble on the table. And yet, many of the laws that govern the universe don’t care which way time flows. So—why does it always move forward?

Welcome to the paradox of the arrow of time.

The Thermodynamic Arrow of Time
At the core of our intuitive experience of time lies entropy, a measure of disorder. According to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, in a closed system, entropy tends to increase.Think of it this way:Ice melts into water.A hot cup of tea cools down in a room.A shuffled deck of cards doesn’t unshuffle itself.These are irreversible processes. They go one way: from order to disorder. Physicists call this the thermodynamic arrow of time.Entropy is the key reason we can distinguish the past from the future. A broken egg on the floor tells us which event came first. But while this law appears absolute in everyday life, it emerges from probability, not fundamental asymmetry. The universe tends toward more probable (disordered) states—not because it must, but because it’s overwhelmingly likely.The Great Paradox: Time-Symmetric Laws
Here’s where the mystery deepens:Nearly all fundamental equations of physics are time-reversible. Newton’s Laws: If you reverse the velocity of a planet, it simply retraces its orbit.Maxwell’s Equations (for electromagnetism): Work just fine in both directions. The Schrödinger Equation (quantum mechanics): Is completely symmetric in time.
So if the core laws of the universe are blind to past or future, why do we observe such strong directionality in the real world? The answer lies not in the laws themselves, but in initial conditions.

Our universe began in an extremely low-entropy state—remarkably ordered. That imbalance set the direction of time’s flow. Ever since the Big Bang, entropy has been increasing, and time has marched forward with it.

Other Arrows of Time
There’s more than one arrow guiding us:

The Psychological Arrow: We remember the past, not the future. This is a direct reflection of entropy: memories are records—low-entropy imprints of high-entropy processes. The act of remembering requires information storage, which itself increases entropy.

The Cosmological Arrow: The universe is expanding, not contracting. If the cosmos ever reversed and started shrinking, would time flow backward too? Some theories speculate that time’s arrow might flip in such a scenario.

The Causal Arrow: Cause precedes effect. We light a match and then see a flame. Reversing this sequence violates our deepest intuitions—but not the equations themselves.

Quantum Mechanics: Still Time-Symmetric?
At the quantum level, time gets even weirder. The Schrödinger equation is symmetric, but quantum measurements—when a system “collapses” into a definite state—seem to break this symmetry. Here, decoherence enters the picture: when quantum systems interact with the environment, they lose their quantum behavior and appear classical. This process is effectively irreversible and might underpin the thermodynamic arrow. Some physicists propose that the act of observation itself helps define the direction of time. But that idea opens up a philosophical can of worms: is time’s flow dependent on consciousness? Or does it only appear that way?

Could Time Be an Illusion?
Some speculative theories propose that time is not fundamental—it’s an emergent property of a deeper, timeless reality.

In this view:The universe exists as a complete 4D block (past, present, future—all at once). The “flow” of time is a psychological construction, an illusion generated by how our brains process information. Entropy’s increase might simply be a statistical pattern embedded in the fabric of this block universe. Physicist Julian Barbour has even argued that “time does not exist” as we think of it. All that exists are “Nows”—individual configurations of the universe—and our experience of continuity is a trick of memory.

Could Time Run Backward in Another Universe?
Some theories of the multiverse or cyclic cosmology suggest that other regions of space-time might operate with a reversed arrow of time. To an observer in such a universe, their arrow would feel just as natural as ours—only backward from our point of view.

This raises haunting questions:
Is the “future” already real? Are we just sliding along a predetermined path in a block universe? Could advanced civilizations exist that experience time differently? So why does time move forward?

The best current answer is this:The laws of physics are symmetric.But our universe began in a very special, low-entropy state.
Since then, entropy has increased, and with it, the illusion or experience of time flowing forward.
Yet this doesn’t feel like a complete answer.The fact that something as universal as time’s arrow arises from initial conditions, not physical laws, leaves us with a deep sense of incompleteness.
If physics doesn’t forbid time from flowing backward, then what truly makes it go forward?Is it entropy? Consciousness? The structure of the cosmos itself? Or is our entire perception of time just a story our minds tell us—to make sense of a universe that’s far stranger than we ever imagined?Time flows like a river—but perhaps only because we’re fish who never learned to swim upstream.
